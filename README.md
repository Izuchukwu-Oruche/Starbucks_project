# Starbucks Offer Completion Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a Starbucks customer will complete a given offer based on their demographic information and offer characteristics. The objective is to understand which features are most influential in determining whether a customer responds to an offer. This analysis can help Starbucks optimize their promotional strategies and target the right customer segments.

## Datasets 
The project uses **three datasets**, all in JSON format:

1. **portfolio.json**: Contains details about different offers, including:
   - `offer_id`: Unique identifier for the offer.
   - `offer_type`: Type of the offer (e.g., BOGO, discount).
   - `difficulty`: Amount the customer needs to spend to complete the offer.
   - `duration`: Duration of the offer in days.
   - `reward`: Reward amount for completing the offer.
   - `channels`: Channels through which the offer was delivered (e.g., web, email).

2. **profile.json**: Contains demographic information for each customer:
   - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
   - `age`: Customer age.
   - `gender`: Gender of the customer.
   - `income`: Annual income of the customer.
   - `became_member_on`: Date when the customer joined the rewards program.

3. **transcript.json**: Records interactions with offers and transactions. Each entry has:
   - `event`: Describes whether an offer was received, viewed, or completed, or if a regular transaction took place.
   - `customer_id`: Identifier linking the transaction to a specific customer.
   - `time`: Number of hours since data collection started.
   - `value`: Contains the `offer_id` if the event is related to an offer.

## Project Setup and Requirements
The project was developed using **Amazon SageMaker Studio**, a cloud-based IDE for machine learning, to streamline the process of data exploration, model training, and evaluation. The following tools and libraries were used:

### Software and Libraries
- **Python 3.8**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting model for classification.
- **SHAP**: Explainability of the modelâ€™s predictions.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for interacting with S3 buckets and other services.
- **SageMaker SDK**: For deploying models and managing SageMaker resources.

### Installing Required Libraries
To install the necessary libraries in your SageMaker environment or local system, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost shap boto3 sagemaker
